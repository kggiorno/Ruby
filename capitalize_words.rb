# Write a method that takes in a string of lowercase letters and
# spaces, producing a new string that capitalizes the first letter of
# each word.
#
# You'll want to use the `split` and `join` methods. Also, the String
# method `upcase`, which converts a string to all upper case will be
# helpful.
#
# Difficulty: medium.

		restOfWord = tempWord[1..-1]
		words[i] = firstLetter.upcase + restOfWord
		i += 1
